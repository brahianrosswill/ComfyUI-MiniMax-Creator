"""`creator_data` (the UI's JSON blob) -> a validated, ordered generation request.

This is the load-bearing module. The `@chip` a user types in the prompt box is
not decoration: it is how they bind a slot to a role ("use @img-2 for her
face"), and H3 only understands that binding through its own ordinal labels,
`<Picture N>` / `<Video N>` / `<Audio N>`.

So the ordinals assigned here MUST match the order the encoder presents
references to the tokenizer, or `<Picture 3>` in the prompt points at the wrong
tensor and the failure is silent — a slightly-wrong video, not an exception.
That order is: images, then videos (each video's soundtrack emitting its
`<Audio j>` label *before* its own `<Video k>`), then standalone audio, with
ordinals counted 1-based per type across that sequence. `encode.py` walks the
lists this module produces in exactly that order; the two must be read together.
