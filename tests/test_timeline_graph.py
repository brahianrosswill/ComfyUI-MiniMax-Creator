"""What `MiniMaxH3Timeline.execute` actually wires up.

`compile_timeline` is covered by `test_compile.py` and needs nothing installed.
This one does: it runs the real node against the real ComfyUI, because the thing
worth checking here is the *graph*, and a stubbed GraphBuilder would only prove
the stub works. Nothing is sampled — `execute` returns a subgraph, so the whole
expansion can be inspected without a model or a single denoising step.
